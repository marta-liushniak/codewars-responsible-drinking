Bar recommends us to drink 1 glass of water per standard drink, so we're not hungover tomorrow morning.
Our fellow coders have bought us several drinks tonight in the form of a String. Return a String suggesting how many glasses of water we should drink to not be hungover.

Examples:   
"1 beer"  →  "**1** glass of water" because you drank one standard drink.  
"1 shot, 5 beers, 2 shots, 1 glass of wine, 1 beer"  →  "**10** glass**es** of water" because you drank ten standard drinks.
